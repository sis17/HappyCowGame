The Happy Cow Game is an educational game teaching the effects of several ingredient types on cow digestion. The aim of this project is to turn this existing board game into a web application that can be played by cow enthusiasts across a network, or by students in a classroom gathered around one machine.

The challenges of the project are the scope of game logic which needs encoding, and creating a usable and friendly interface. This was managed by creating a server side API which provided the data the game needed. On top of this a client framework was used to render a seamless game play environment which guided user actions, provided feedback and thereby suggested what to do next. Unlike board game users, people who use web applications often do not have time for pages of instructions. It was therefore important that the application not only made the game controls clear, but hinted at how they should be used.

Testing was vital to ensure the project met its requirements. For the game logic, comprehensive server side automated testing was carried out. To ensure the user interface matched user expectations a number of meetings were arranged with real users. Feedback from these events led to quite a few design changes, with more planned if development continues after the scope of this project.
