I had the four phases of the main game phase as four different pages already. My plan was to make these partly functional pages, pulling static data from the server. The second phase of development in a few weeks time would then be to persist data on the server, and actually make the game playable.

This worked quite well. I had taken a bit of time to familarise myself with AngularJS, the client side choise of framework, and read a few chapters about simple development in the O'Reilley guide. However, the best way to learn a language is to take time reading, but also write a substantial project using it, otherwise all the information too easily slips from one's head. I began development, quickly ran into problems, but uncovered mis-understandings of how AngularJS is used, and bit by bit learned how best to use it.

### A Server and Development Process

I found that RedHat offer free hosting for up to three web applications, and give support for Ruby on Rails as well. Their system can pull a project directly from GitHub and then deploy it. I spent a few hours setting this up, and creating a Rails framework
