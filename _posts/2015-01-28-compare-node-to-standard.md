Choice of framework depends on what you are trying to do.

Node.js is quick and fast. It lets you implement more functionallity from scratch, and is a learning experience.

More developed frameworks such as Rails is safer, and provides more documentation, but can force your hand by requiring an application to be 
created in a certain way.
