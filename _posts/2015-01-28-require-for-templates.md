This blog explains that require.js is used for loading in libraries, Javascript, CSS, ect. However, it can also be used to load in templates
when using Underscore.js, Handlebars.js or Moustache.js to render templates in a Javascript framework.

This was good news as it saved me from making a poor hand written attempt with and Ajax request.
