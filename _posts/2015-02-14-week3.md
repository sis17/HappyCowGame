Resources from this week are available [here](http://sis17.github.io/HappyCowGame/designs/).

### Design Documentation
At the beginning of this week I began to make some HTML template pages to get a firmer idea of how they game would work. Such as how the client side would work, what resources were necessary to persist, ect. This was helpful, but made me want to dive straight into the development. I continued with the designs, however, and met more problems that were worthy of thinking about. When I start development, it should now be fairly simple to take the existing templates and work towards the plan of the design. I will almost certainly need to make changes along the way, but at least I have thought about most aspects and taken the time to write these thoughts down.

### Database Design
This was probably the most difficult part of the planning. It also has the largest effect on the structure of the project.
