### 3rd Generation Javascript

Node.js is Javascript in it's third generation. First Javascript created small changes on static HTML pages, such as displaying dates and
changing colours. Then in the second generation it supported Ajax requests to asyncronously load data to a page, querying the server behind
the scenes. In this generation Javascript runs the webserver itself, it has moved server side to generate web pages. So this is Javascript
with even more power, the whole web-stack in one language.
