The Google Play Game Services offer good support for simple client side games that need a way to authenticate users and provide levels, 
leaderboards, or achievements. However, it does not offer anything else, and so does not fulfill the scope required by my project.

If there was not a need for data to be persisted, it would be a viable option. The game could be played in one sitting with users at the same
machine/interface, and then user's scores could be maintained. However, that type of application is overly simplistic for the level of project
I want to build.

Using OAuth is something to keep in mind, however. An extra feature could be logging in via Google or Facebook.
