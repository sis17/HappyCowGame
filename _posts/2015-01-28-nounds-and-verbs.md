Nouns are things like rocks, trees, houses, people, heads and hands. Verbs are actions, run, do, take out the garbage, eat. We use both nouns and verbs
in every day life to accomplish actions on things. However, OO languages, especially Java, restricts users to attaching verbs to nouns. This
can be counter-intuitive at times, by being over restrictive.
