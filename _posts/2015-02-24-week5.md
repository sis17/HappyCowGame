### Server Setup
[RedHat Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) allows a user to host up to 3 simple-ish web applications for free. This suits the need of the project, as I need to deploy the game publicly in order for others, including Gabriel the client, to test.

Openshift provides start up frameworks and plug and use databases. So I chose Ruby on Rails 4, and MySQL 2. Even better, sites on Openshift are managed by GitHub integration. However, it requires the project is set up on Openshift, and then cloned. This involved creating a new rails application, cloning it to my machine, and then copying the work form last week into that new app.

Before I could do this however, Ruby Gems proved a nuisance. Installing the MySQL2 gem took some work and file changes, and depended on other gems which also took some file permission wrangling. In the end, everything was installed and worked, but of course, these are all unexpected trials which take time not accounted for.

### Back-end Database, Models, and Controllers
