There are 2 types of client side storage possible: session storage and local storage. Both allow an application to store data in the web browser
between page requests, making session easier and smoother to manage. Local storage is a persistent version of session storage, available to any tab
 and accessible forever, unless deleted by the application. There is a 5MB limit on storage per application imposed by the browsers.
