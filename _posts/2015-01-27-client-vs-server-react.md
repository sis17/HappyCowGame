React.js is a library which helps to blend client and server interaction. A common problem in web applications is that a page loads, but data and widgets
must then be assembled, taking time before all the content of the page can be seen. Yet this information should have been available from the start,
based on the request given to the server.

So React.js is a library that manages two DOM trees, one that is actually Javascript, and another which returns a string, and can be quickly rendered to a page.
There are a number of technologies that, when combined with React.js, could make web applications smooth and sensible.

This is something to consider learning and using in my project.
