Has an impressive portfolio of games developed using it. It allows games to be quickly and easly deployed world wide with cloud server hosting
and pre-built game components, such as matching players and putting them in a game together.

It's a bit pricy though, and does not focus on board games.

### Coco2D-x

This is the open source version of the Coco2D platform. It can be used to make 2D games, or simple 3D adventure games. Commonly used for 
mobile game development.

### Vassal

This is not web based, but runs on client Java software. Players make decisions and the game updates other players via the game engine messaging
or via email. It is designed for board games.

This article explains a bit more about Vassal, it often does not implement any rules, but expects players to behave as if they were playing
the board game themselves.
