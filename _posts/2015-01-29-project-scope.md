### What is Scope?

"Project scope is the part of project planning that involves determining and documenting a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs and deadlines."

 * definition from [searchcio.techtarget.com](searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/project-scope)
 
### Determined Project Goals
The Happy Cow board game must be playable as originally created:

* Players can log in or sign up
* Players choose an existing game, or make one with friends at the same machine
* Players each hace a deck of cards, get more cards and can lay cards
* There are turns and phases
* Players can choose which package to animage, and choose between dice amounts
* Players can move their packages with mouse interaction
* Packages can be damaged
* Information about the cow is always visible, to show cow health, etc.

### Possible Extra Goals
* Messaging between players, in and out of games
* Cards can be adaptable, players can therefore choose which deck to play with when starting
* More specific ingredients can be created and used, with extra side effects
* 2 game types, between players across a network, and with players at the same machine
